                    I moved to Ottawa, the capital city of Canada, many years ago and immediately fell in love. Ottawa is a great city to live and has a reputation for being one of the best cities to live in North America.

                    I discovered my life’s passion in real estate after a career in facilities engineering specializing in multi-million projects, and each day I  look forward to doing what I love. As Ottawa’s real estate market and technologies change over time, I have constantly evolved and educated myself to achieve more for my clients and help their real estate dreams come true.
